Crowd sourced earthquake intensity maps provide disaster managers with real-time information on the intensity
of earthquakes while also giving earthquake researchers valuable data to help estimate the shaking from future earthquakes.
The goal is to create a smartphone app that will allow users to report earthquake shaking intensity and building damage information
via their smartphone.
